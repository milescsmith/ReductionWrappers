\arguments{
\item{n.components}{integer (default: 3) Dimension of the embedded space.}

\item{perplexity}{numeric (default: 30) The perplexity is related to the
number of nearest neighbors that is used in other manifold learning
algorithms. Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity. Consider
selecting a value between 5 and 50. The choice is not extremely critical
since t-SNE is quite insensitive to this parameter.}

\item{early.exaggeration}{numeric (default: 12.0) Controls how tight natural
clusters in the original space are in the embedded space and how much space
will be between them. For larger values, the space between natural clusters
will be larger in the embedded space. Again, the choice of this parameter
is not very critical. If the cost function increases during initial
optimization, the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate might be
too high.}

\item{learning.rate}{numeric (default: 200.0) The learning rate for t-SNE is
usually in the range [10.0, 1000.0]. If the learning rate is too high, the
data may look like a ‘ball’ with any point approximately equidistant from
its nearest neighbours. If the learning rate is too low, most points may
look compressed in a dense cloud with few outliers. If the cost function
gets stuck in a bad local minimum increasing the learning rate may help.}

\item{n.iter}{integer (default: 1000) Maximum number of iterations for the
optimization. Should be at least 250.}

\item{n.iter.without.progress}{integer (default: 300) Maximum number of
iterations without progress before we abort the optimization, used after
250 initial iterations with early exaggeration. Note that progress is only
checked every 50 iterations so this value is rounded to the next multiple
of 50.}

\item{min.grad.norm}{numeric (default: 1e-7) If the gradient norm is below
this threshold, the optimization will be stopped.}

\item{metric}{string or callable The metric to use when calculating distance
between instances in a feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one
of the options allowed by scipy.spatial.distance.pdist for its metric
parameter, or a metric listed in pairwise.PAIRWISE.DISTANCE.FUNCTIONS. If
metric is “precomputed”, X is assumed to be a distance matrix.
Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each pair
of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable should
take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating the distance
between them. The default is “euclidean” which is interpreted as squared
euclidean distance.}

\item{init}{string or numpy array (default: “random”) Initialization of
embedding. Possible options are ‘random’, ‘pca’, and a numpy array of shape
(n.samples, n.components). PCA initialization cannot be used with
precomputed distances and is usually more globally stable than random
initialization.}

\item{verbose}{integer (default: 0) Verbosity level.}

\item{random.state}{int, RandomState instance or NULL (default: NULL) If int,
random.state is the seed used by the random number generator; If
RandomState instance, random.state is the random number generator; If NULL,
the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random.
Note that different initializations might result in different local minima
of the cost function.}

\item{method}{string (default: ‘barnes.hut’) By default the gradient
calculation algorithm uses Barnes-Hut approximation running in O(NlogN)
time. method=’exact’ will run on the slower, but exact, algorithm in O(N^2)
time. The exact algorithm should be used when nearest-neighbor errors need
to be better than 3%. However, the exact method cannot scale to millions of
examples.}

\item{angle}{numeric (default: 0.5) Only used if method=’barnes.hut’ This is
the trade-off between speed and accuracy for Barnes-Hut T-SNE. ‘angle’ is
the angular size (referred to as theta in [3]) of a distant node as
measured from a point. If this size is below ‘angle’ then it is used as a
summary node of all points contained within it. This method is not very
sensitive to changes in this parameter in the range of 0.2 - 0.8. Angle
less than 0.2 has quickly increasing computation time and angle greater 0.8
has quickly increasing error.#' @param cheat_metric}
